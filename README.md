Gambling Web:

Overview:
In this project I created a simulation of a soccer league where several teams compete against each other throughout a season. 
- In each round of games, teams compete against each other, and the table will be automatically updated according to these results. 
- The results of the games and the score table are displayed in two different dashboards. 
- The results of the games will be determined by an algorithm that takes into account two factors: skill levels and home or away game in addition to random variables that will run every minute. 
-Users will be able to register on the site and bet on game results, with a betting system that reflects the odds based on the team's performance. 
- The project includes user registration and login, team and game management, dynamic match results generator and live dashboards to track ongoing games and individual bets.
